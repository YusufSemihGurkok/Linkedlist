Singly Linked List Implementation
This repository contains C code that demonstrates the implementation of a singly linked list. The program provides various operations to manipulate the linked list, such as inserting elements at the beginning, end, or specified position, deleting elements from the beginning, end, or specified position, and reversing the list.

Usage
After running the program, you will be presented with a menu where you can choose different operations on the linked list:

Create: Creates a new linked list by adding elements to it.
Insert at the beginning: Inserts an element at the beginning of the linked list.
Insert at the end: Inserts an element at the end of the linked list.
Insert at specified position: Inserts an element at a specified position in the linked list.
Delete from beginning: Deletes the first element from the linked list.
Delete from the end: Deletes the last element from the linked list.
Delete from specified position: Deletes an element from a specified position in the linked list.
Reverse: Reverses the order of elements in the linked list.
Exit: Quits the program.
Follow the prompts on the screen to input your choices and interact with the linked list.
